# Refactor Code Project

In this project we are asked to **refactor** the existing code in the _Horiseon Online Marketing Services_ website to improve its codebase readability, sustainability, and to meet accessibility standards. We achieved this by organizing a semantic HTML layout that follows a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. In addition, _alt and heading attributes_ were added to help improve and meet accessibility standards. Lastly, CSS code was refarctored, commented, and reorganized to improve readibility and longterm sustainability of the codebase.
